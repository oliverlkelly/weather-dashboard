# Weather Dashboard

## The Task

To create a functional weather dashboard to allow users to search for a city and find the weather in searched city. The weather dashboard should present the weather data in a clean and legible manner, and should have a 5 day forcast beneath the current day.

This project allowed me to learn more about the following;
- Javascript implimentation and use
- The ability to take a set of criteria and create a website that follows those criteria
- The use of Third-Party API's and handling their data
- A deeper understanding of local storage and manipulating local storage
- A deeper understanding of Javascript and it things you can do with it

## Installation

This project is a webpage, and is deployed on github pages through the following link:
    https://oliverlkelly.github.io/weather-dashboard/

The site can also be deployed locally by pulling the file structure to your local machine and opening the index.html file in your browser of preference.

## Usage

This project can be used as a website. There are other components of the site that can be used for reference, such as the methods and logic used to present the weather to the user, and collect the data from the API.
